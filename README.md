### Overview

In this assignment, I used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. The GIPHY API has been called and JavaScript and jQuery has been used to change the HTML of my site.

![GIPHY](Images/1-giphy.jpg)


When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page. 

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

A form has been added to the page that takes the value from a user input box and adds it into your `topics` array. Then make a function call that takes each topic in the array remakes the buttons on the page.
